        <h1>Neue Haas Grotesk vs. Helvetica Neue </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Neue Haas Grotesk</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>In 1957, Eduard Hoffman, President of the Haas type foundry in Switzerland, commissioned Max Miedinger to design Neue Haas Grotesk to rival the popular sans typeface of the time, Akzidenz-Grotesk. Breaking down the typeface name, Neue Haas Grotesk is simply a description of the typeface. “Neue” means “new” in German, “Haas” refers to the Haas Type Foundry where the typeface was born, and “Grotesk” is a description of the design style, referencing Neo-grotesque. It was immediately successful and became a hallmark of contemporary Swiss graphic design. About four years after its release, Neue Haas Grotesk became available for use with the Linotype machine in the international market and from there became known as the iconic typeface, Helvetica. 
			 </p>

			 <p>In 2004, Christian Schwartz was commissioned to restore Neue Haas Grotesk. The project took nearly ten years, and this time the designer has redrawn the typeface with “as much fidelity to the original shapes and spacing as possible” to match Miedinger’s original forms. </p>
             
			 <h3>Helvetica Neue</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Helvetica, commonly referred to as the world’s most famous typeface, was born from Neue Haas Grotesk and later changed to be called Helvetica after “Helvetia”, the Latin name for Switzerland. It wasn’t long before Helvetica became the standard for advertising and corporate branding around the world, but especially in the West. Its mix of features, or lack thereof, happened to be exactly what designers were looking for: “ a typeface apparently devoid of personality,” said Ellen Lupton, curator of contemporary design at the Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York ,“Helvetica met our craving for corporate vanilla”. On the other hand, Helvetica has been heavily used by the US government as the standard typeface for federal income tax forms, in Europe for legally required health warnings on tobacco products, and in transportation settings, most famously adopted by the New York City Subway System signage designed by Massimo Vignelli. </p>

			 <p><b>Helvetica Neue</b>, created in 1983 by D.Stempel AG, is a reworking of the original typeface which was designed in order to consolidate its structure and enhance balance which was initially limited due to the inherent inhibitions of typesetting technologies of the mid 20th century. 
				The refinements from Helvetica to Helvetica Neue included adjusting character weights, proportions, and spacing. These subtle changes improved legibility and increased versatility for use in print and digital media.
				</p>

			 <p>While Neue Haas Grotesk holds historical significance as the precursor to Helvetica, Helvetica Neue represents a refined evolution of this iconic typeface. Together, they continue to influence contemporary typography and remain go-to choices for designers seeking clarity and readability in their work. </p>
